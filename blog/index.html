                    <p>Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist? Just my luck, no ice. Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates don't eat the tourists. Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right?</p>                    
                    <p>Yes, Yes, without the oops! Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates don't eat the tourists. God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs. Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.</p>

                    <p>They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking. Checkmate... Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! What do they got in there? King Kong? We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore!</p>                    
                    <p>So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? Life finds a way. God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs. God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs.</p>

I was part of something special. Life finds a way. We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore!</p>
                    <p>Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance. Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should. Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine?</p>
                    <p>My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard! God help us, we're in the hands of engineers. Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.</p>
